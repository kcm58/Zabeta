# *Mora* provides restful services and richer JSON support for Google
# App Engine (GAE). Mora intends to be lightweight and unobtrusive.

### Motivation

# This module provides a dispatcher and REST handler class you can use
# to make your own RESTful graphs. A RESTful graph API has an
# organization similar to Facebook's graph api and is a bit
# different than the default way most other frameworks implement REST.
# 
# To get a Student object with Mora you might send a GET request to:
#
#     /graph/ag9kZXZ-YmVhbmdyaW5kZXJyCgsSBFVzZXIYAQw
#
# You don't specify that you want a user resource because GAE already
# has this embedded in the key.  You can then use PUT and DELETE http
# verbs to update and remove the object.  Now if you want to get a
# list of courses the user is in, you send a GET to:
#
#     /graph/ag9kZXZ-YmVhbmdyaW5kZXJyCgsSBFVzZXIYAQw/courses
#
# And if you want to add a course, you send a POST to the same URL.
# There are no nested resource calls because they are unneccessary.

### Dependencies

# We import some standard modules and also Google App Engine's `db`
# and `polymodel` modules.  We have to dig at GAE's guts a bit to
# shoehorn in better per type JSON support but most of this can be
# accomplished with simple subclassing.
import logging
import sys
import inspect
from mora import db

# GAE supports a couple of versions of Python and the GAE environment.
# We will try to use the latest modules and then use `ImportError`
# exceptions to select older variations.
try:
    import json
except ImportError:
    from django.utils import simplejson as json

try:
    import webapp2 as webapp
except ImportError:
    from google.appengine.ext import webapp


### Decorators

# `show`, `update`, and `delete` are the only named REST action
# methods in `RestHandler`.  All other REST actions must be
# accomplished with special method decorators.  These decorators
# attach REST HTTP verbs to functions.
#
# To setup an index for courses, we could write:
#
#      @rest_index("courses")
#      def course_list(self):
#          # return the courses..
def rest_index(keyword):
    def wrap(f):
        def wrapped(*args, **kwargs):
            return f(*args, **kwargs)
        setattr(wrapped, "_mora_verb", ("GET " + keyword, f.func_name))
        return wrapped
    return wrap


# Similarly we might want to be able to add a new course.  rest_create
# attaches the POST verb to a function so that we can write:
#
#      @rest_create("courses")
#      def course_create(self):
#          # create a course..
def rest_create(keyword):
    def wrap(f):
        def wrapped(*args, **kwargs):
            return f(*args, **kwargs)
        setattr(wrapped, "_mora_verb", ("POST " + keyword, f.func_name))
        return wrapped
    return wrap


# And there may be some occasions where you need to take some special
# action on an item that doesn't fall into one of the usual 'index',
# 'create', 'update', 'destroy', or 'show' actions.  These should be
# annotated with the rest_action decorator:
#
#      @rest_create("like")
#      def like(self):
#          # execute a like action on the user
def rest_action(keyword):
    def wrap(f):
        def wrapped(*args, **kwargs):
            return f(*args, **kwargs)
        setattr(wrapped, "_mora_verb", ("POST " + keyword, f.func_name))
        return wrapped
    return wrap


### Dispatcher Exceptions

# DispatchErrors may be thrown when something goes wrong and will be
# caught at the RequestHandler stage.  When you throw an error you
# should set the code and message.  Some standard codes and messages
# that Mora throws internally include:
#
# * 400: InvalidHttpVerb
# * 400: InvalidUri
# * 404: ResourceNotFound
# * 405: UnsupportedHttpVerb
class DispatchError(Exception):

    def __init__(self, code=None, message=None):
        super(DispatchError, self).__init__()
        self.code = code
        self.message = message

### REST Dispatcher

# The `RestDispatcher` is a request handler that gets passed to
# webapp.  We then spawn our custom RestHandlers from here.
class RestDispatcher(webapp.RequestHandler):

    base_path = ""
    rest_handlers = {}


    # We setup the dispatcher with a path it should use and a list of
    # RestHandlers connected to specific models.
    @classmethod
    def setup(cls, path, handlers):
        cls.base_path = path
        for rest_handler in handlers:
            cls.connect(rest_handler)


    # We pass back a reference to the base_path and this class as the
    # routing pair.
    @classmethod
    def route(cls):
        return (cls.base_path + "/.*", RestDispatcher)


    @classmethod
    def connect(cls, rest_handler):

        # scan their methods looking for methods that were decorated
        # as rest actions.

### RestHandler

# The RestHandler is attached to the model, request, and response.

# or create new methods.

    def setup(self):
        pass

    # REST methods should be very lightweight.  Use the as_json method
    # to push business logic into the model.  Here are some example
    # implementations for each method:

    # Example:
    #
    #     def show(self):
    #       self.response.out.write(self.model.to_json())
    def show(self):
        raise DispatchError(405, "UnsupportedHttpVerb")

    # Example:
    #
    #     def update(self):
    #       self.model.from_json(self.params)
    def update(self):
        raise DispatchError(405, "UnsupportedHttpVerb")

    # Example:
    #
    #     def destroy(self):
    #       self.model.delete()
    #       self.response.out.write({})
    def destroy(self):
